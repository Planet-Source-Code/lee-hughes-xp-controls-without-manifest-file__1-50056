### Description

Don’t do XP controls on WinXP the hard way, add these 2 files to your project, job done. No manifest file required.

The traditional way is to create a manifest file and distribute this along with your program. The more advanced way is to create it dynamically at run time. Both ways are messy and I have seen lots of bad examples and ripped off code on PSC. After this submisson I hope I wont see any more!

This code takes it a step further and gets rid of the manifest file completely and replaces it with a resource which compiles directly into your exe. No more .exe.manifest files!

Please give feedback.
